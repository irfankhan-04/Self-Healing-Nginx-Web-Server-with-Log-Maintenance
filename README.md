# 🛠️ Self-Healing Nginx Web Server with Log Maintenance

This project demonstrates how to deploy a static portfolio website using **Nginx** on a **Linux-based AWS EC2 instance**, along with automation scripts to ensure high availability and clean log management.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

- ✅ Hosted a static HTML portfolio site using **Nginx** on an EC2 instance.
- 🔁 Created a **self-healing Bash script** that automatically restarts Nginx if it goes down.
- ⏰ Configured a **cron job** to run the health check script every minute.
- 🧹 Developed a **log cleanup script** that deletes Nginx log files older than 7 days.
- 📅 Scheduled the cleanup script to run daily via cron for disk maintenance.

## 📝 Sample Cron Jobs

```bash
# Check and restart Nginx every minute
* * * * * /home/ec2-user/nginx-monitor.sh >> /home/ec2-user/nginx-monitor.log 2>&1

# Delete old logs daily at 1 AM
0 1 * * * /home/ec2-user/delete-old-logs.sh >> /home/ec2-user/log-cleanup.log 2>&1
📌 How to Use
Launch an EC2 instance and install Nginx.

Upload your index.html to /usr/share/nginx/html/.

Upload both scripts to your instance and make them executable:


chmod +x nginx-monitor.sh delete-old-logs.sh
Set up cron jobs using crontab -e.

💡 Future Improvements
Add SSL using Let's Encrypt

Set up monitoring alerts (email, push)

Use systemd for more robust service monitoring
